### The Easiest Way to Add "Auto-Off" Timers to Your Smart Home

Are you new to **Home Assistant** and struggling with complex YAML code? **EntityTimer Pro** is here to help you automate your home without the headache.

## What is this?
Ever turned on a garden valve and forgot to turn it off? Or left the AC running all night? 
EntityTimer Pro uses AI to build a "Smart Timer" system for any device in your home. It writes the code for you, so you don't have to.

## How it works (for beginners)
1.  **Take a Screenshot**: Open your Home Assistant app and take a screenshot of your dashboard.
2.  **Upload**: Drop that screenshot into this app. Our AI will automatically "see" your devices (like valves, lights, or AC units).
3.  **Configure**: Choose how many minutes you want the timer to last.
4.  **Copy & Paste**: The app gives you specific blocks of code and tells you exactly where to put them in your Home Assistant files.

## 🌟 Why use this?
*   **Safety First**: Great for water valves or heaters to ensure they never stay on forever.
*   **No Coding Needed**: You don't need to learn how to write complex automations; the AI handles the logic.
*   **Privacy Protected**: We use a "Bring Your Own Key" system. Your smart home data never touches our servers—it goes straight from your browser to Google's secure AI.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1.  **Get your AI Key**: Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) and click "Get API Key". It's free to start!
2.  **Activate**: Click the **Activate** button in this app and paste your key.
3.  **Setup HA**: Make sure your Home Assistant is ready for "Packages" (see our [Installation Guide](DOCUMENTATION.md) for a simple 1-minute setup).
