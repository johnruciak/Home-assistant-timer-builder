# ⏱️ EntityTimer Pro
### Add "Auto-Off" timers to Home Assistant devices without writing code.

EntityTimer Pro generates the YAML configuration needed to add countdown timers to your Home Assistant switches, valves, lights, and climate units. It is designed specifically for **new users** who want to add smart safety features to their home without mastering technical coding.

## 📖 Essential Reading
*   **[Technical Documentation & Setup Guide](DOCUMENTATION.md)** - Read this first to prepare your Home Assistant files.

## 🛠️ How to Use

### 1. Quick Entry (Fastest)
Use this if you already know the technical ID of your device.
*   **Where to find the ID**: In Home Assistant, go to **Developer Tools > States**. Look for the `entity_id` column (e.g., `switch.living_room_fan` or `valve.garden_tap`).
*   **How to setup**: Paste the ID into the "Quick Entry" field in this app.

### 2. Entity Sync (Recommended for Lists)
Import your entire device list to quickly pick what you need.
*   **Using HACS**: For the best experience, we recommend installing the [Entity Exporter Card](https://github.com/scharc/ha-entity-exporter-card). 
*   **What is HACS?**: If you don't have it yet, [HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)](https://hacs.xyz/) is a "plugin store" that lets you add community-made features to your home. It's a must-have for any new user.
*   **Manual Sync**: You can also go to **Developer Tools > States**, highlight the whole table, copy it, and paste it into the "Manual" tab in this app's Entity Sync center.

### 3. Drop Screen (Experimental)
*   **How it works**: Take a screenshot of your Home Assistant dashboard and drop it into this app. Our AI will try to "see" your buttons and guess their IDs.
*   **Note**: This is experimental. High-resolution screenshots work best.

## 🚀 Activation & Privacy
This application uses a **Bring Your Own Key** model. 
1.  Generate a key at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2.  Click **Activate** in this app. 
3.  **Privacy**: Your smart home data is never sent to our servers. It stays in your browser and communicates directly with Google's AI.

## 📦 Important: Preparing Home Assistant
Before you can use the code generated by this app, you **must** create three specific folders in your Home Assistant configuration directory.
1.  `packages`
2.  `automations`
3.  `scripts`

You can do this using the **File Editor** or **VS Code** add-ons in Home Assistant. See the [Documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md) for exactly how to link these folders.
