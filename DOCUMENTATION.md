# Technical Documentation: EntityTimer Pro

## 1. Overview
EntityTimer Pro is a client-side web application designed to bridge the gap between Home Assistant's UI and its underlying YAML configuration. It utilizes the **Google Gemini 3 Pro** model to perform visual entity mapping and code generation.

## 2. Mandatory Setup (Read Carefully)
To use the code generated by this app, your Home Assistant must be configured to use "Packages" and "Dir Lists." 

### Step A: Install a File Editor
You need a way to edit your Home Assistant files. Go to **Settings > Add-ons** and install either:
- **File Editor** (Simple and recommended for beginners)
- **Studio Code Server** (More advanced, like a desktop code editor)

### Step B: Create Folders
Using your file editor, navigate to your `/config/` folder and create these three folders. **Home Assistant will crash if you try to include them in Step C before they actually exist.**
1. `/config/packages/`
2. `/config/automations/`
3. `/config/scripts/`

### Step C: Update configuration.yaml
Add these exact lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:
```yaml
homeassistant:
  packages: !include_dir_named packages/

automation: !include_dir_list automations/
script: !include_dir_list scripts/
```

## 3. AI Implementation
The app uses two distinct AI pipelines:

### A. Vision Discovery (`analyzeImage`)
- **Model**: `gemini-3-pro-preview`
- **Purpose**: Parses dashboard screenshots to extract technical `entity_id` values.
- **Logic**: Filters for "controllable" domains (valves, lights, switches, climate) and ignores sensors or read-only entities.

### B. YAML Architect (`generateYaml`)
- **Model**: `gemini-3-pro-preview`
- **Purpose**: Generates logically separated YAML blocks.
- **Strategy**: It produces a "Modular Package" which includes:
    1. `input_number`: A helper for the user to adjust duration on the fly.
    2. `timer`: The countdown entity.
    3. `script`: The execution logic that turns on the device and starts the timer.
    4. `automation`: The "Safety" logic that turns the device off when the timer ends.

## 4. Security & Privacy
- **Direct API Communication**: All requests go directly from the client's browser to `generativelanguage.googleapis.com`.
- **Key Management**: Uses the official `window.aistudio` key selection flow.
- **No Persistence**: The app does not maintain a database of entities or screenshots.
